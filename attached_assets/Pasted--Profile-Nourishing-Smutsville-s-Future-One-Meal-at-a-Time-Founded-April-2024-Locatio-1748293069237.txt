Our Story

What began as a single act of kindness on Easter Sunday 2024 has blossomed into a vital community lifeline. A young entrepreneurial couple, founders of Curious Cat Creative, had recently moved to Sedgefield and partnered with their housekeeper, Mina, a Smutsville township resident with a passion for cooking. Inspired by Mina’s dream to be a chef and their own commitment to South Africa’s development, they sponsored a hearty three-course meal of braaied chicken, potato salad, savoury rice, and malva pudding for 100 children in Smutsville.

The overwhelming gratitude from those kids—just for knowing someone cared—ignited a spark. What started as a one-off event became a weekly commitment. Today, Mina’s Kitchen feeds 500 children every Saturday, having served over 12,000 meals in our first year. As we approach our one-year anniversary this Easter 2025, we’re more determined than ever to scale up and impact more lives.

What We Do

Every Saturday at the Smutsville Community Centre, our team transforms simple ingredients into nourishing meals for 500 township children aged 2-16. Led by Mina, who brings years of restaurant kitchen experience, our rotating team of 6-10 local women—her friends, cousins, aunties, and mother—prepares balanced, nutritious meals using locally-sourced, organic produce. Most of these women are unemployed or work part-time as cleaners, and the R500 they earn per feeding is a transformative opportunity.

Each week brings logistical challenges—equipment must be transported to and from the community hall kitchen—but the team’s dedication never falters. Meals are served in eco-friendly, recyclable packaging, reflecting our commitment to sustainability. We’ve also launched a new initiative where older children clean up Smutsville’s streets while waiting for meals, fostering community pride and responsibility.

Mina’s journey as our housekeeper revealed her culinary talent. Trained in local restaurants, she lost her job during COVID and turned to cleaning to support her three children. Hired full-time by the founders in 2023, her impressive cooking inspired the Easter meal that started it all. Now, she’s living her dream as a chef, leading a team that’s changing lives.

Future Vision

Broader Vision

Mina’s Kitchen is building a foundation for a stronger South Africa through three interconnected pillars, funded separately and rolled out progressively. Smutsville is our pilot project, with plans to replicate this model across other townships:

- Nutrition: Our current focus, feeding 500 kids every Saturday with balanced, organic meals to support their health and readiness to learn. A permanent kitchen in Sedgefield town will enable weekday feedings, with excess funds from our R500,000 goal kickstarting this setup.
- Education: With additional funding, we aim to launch early childhood development (ECD) programs, possibly in 2025, to give kids foundational learning for a brighter future.
- Skills Development: Future funding will support skills training for older kids, equipping them for success and completing the empowerment cycle.

The permanent kitchen will also serve as a hub for a frozen meals business, including homemade pet food, generating income to sustain Mina’s Kitchen. This will provide more work for the women, utilize excess food, and ensure financial stability. Professional kitchen training courses for the women will further their skills and empowerment, aligning with our vision of holistic community growth.

Together, these pillars—nutrition, education, and skills development—promote a healthier, more educated, and empowered nation. By funding each phase in a rolling fashion, we ensure sustainability and impact, refining our approach in Smutsville to scale nationwide and drive South Africa’s economic growth through its youth.
